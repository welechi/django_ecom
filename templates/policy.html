        <div class="hdright"><a name="Orderprocess"></a>
        	<h2>Order Process</h2>
            <div class="pt10"><p style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I SUBMIT MY ORDER VIA YOUR WEBSITE?</p>
			<p>Once you submit your order, a credit card authorization hold occurs for the full amount.  An authorization checks if your credit card is valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the online transaction. The total amount of the online transaction is held and deducted from your credit card limit.  Even though the funds are held and deducted from your credit limit, the funds are not automatically transferred to us until we capture the funds. Typically we try to capture funds and ship your order within a 7 day window.  However, some pieces may take longer to produce and therefore may not ship for 2-3 weeks from date of order.</p>
 			<p style="font-weight:bold;">HOW LONG DOES A CREDIT CARD AUTHORIZATION LAST?</p>
			<p>The credit card authorization period can last up to 7 days in which we are able to issue a credit card capture to retrieve the funds from your account.  If the credit card authorization has not been captured within the 7 days the authorization becomes void.  The funds are no longer held from your account and are put back into your account.  The length of time it takes for the funds to be put back depends on your credit card issuing bank but is usually 3-5 business days.</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT IS VERIFICATION/EXTRA VERIFICATION ?</p>
			<p>Once an order is placed, it is sent to our verification department where we monitor any transaction for possible fraud. Depending on the nature of the transaction, the order may be sent to “Extra-Verification”. In this process, you will be sent an email requesting some form of identification (License, Passport, etc.) as well as the credit card used for the purchase (Last 4 digits). In extreme cases, you maybe asked to send a photo of yourself holding both items (picture will be attached to email as an example). This is done to ensure that the person placing the order is, in fact, the cardholder. Keep in mind that we do not save these emails in our server, but rather attach them to your customer profile so that you can avoid this process in the future should you place a future order.</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY ORDER?</p>
			<p>We do our best to turn orders around as quickly as possible, but some items can take up to 2-3 weeks to receive.  If you need something by a certain date or would like to expedite shipping, please make sure to put that in the notes section of your order, or send us an email at <a href="mailto:zhangziyijewelry@gmail.com" class="link">zhangziyijewelry@gmail.com</a> We will always do our best to accommodate your requests and we appreciate your understanding and patience.</p>

            <div class="pt10"><font><strong>Your satisfaction is our #1 priority</strong></font> Zhang Ziyi Jewels is arguably the most secure <strong>diamond jewelry</strong> website online today. We use secure HTTP protocol during checkout for 100% client information protection. There is no better way to secure your money than with a jewelry purchase. Historically, diamonds have gone up in value almost every single year since such rare commodities never go out of fashion.

We can match any sized budget for the gemstone investment you'll make, whether it's black diamonds or white. Black diamond jewelry is remarkably affordable while still retaining that diamond edge and shine. Zhang Ziyi Jewels is always here to help you make the best purchase possible. We have a high percentage of repeat customers that love our service and products. State-of-the-art online security teamed with great pieces at ground-level prices – you'll never need to visit an 'offline' diamond jewelry store again (though we do have a showroom for your persual in Midtown Manhattan). </div>
